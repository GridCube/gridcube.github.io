<p>  Arianna's blood dripped on the cell's floor. Jurgar standing beyond the magic circle that locked her from performing any spell. </p>
</p>
<p>  "You really though that you would be able to take a piece of my soul for your silly artifice?" he asked mocking her.</p>
<p>Arianna fell on her knees and started laughing, "No you stupid piece of shit" she said, rasing her head to look at the Werewolf king. "We knew of your stupid spies, that was never the point." she kept laughing harder and harder. She was in the castle, she had done it, and the stupid Dark Lord had severed her connection to the homming artifice. which meant it was already falling, a device that hosted a tiny piece of her soul, almost none of it really, but that was enough, souls like to be full, so the artifice knew were she was, and was comming for her. Of course the artifice also contained several other things, like an air/fire capacitor bank that turned kinetic energy into thrust while also powering a simple air spell that rarified atmosphere infront the artifice, the result was simple.</p>
<p>  The artifice was falling eleven times faster than sound.</p>
<p></p>
<p>  Made of crystals and metals engraved with also simple earth runes that increased it's integrity to a point of absurdity given the current kinectic thaumaturgic conversion.</p>
<p>  Jurgar laugh dissapeared of his face as soon as the prisoner had started laughing, and as soon as he realized the mistake he was already running toward the most fortified section of his castle.</p>
<p>  The artifice took a little time to reach Arianna, the point was never to kill the Dark Lord, she knew that. She had offered for the mission.</p>
<p>  The artifice hit the castle with more force than any spell that has ever been casted. In an instant vaporizing the room in which Arianna was tied, still laughing.Â  Most of the castle was turn onto rubble. most prisoners were dead, for sure this round. And even if Jurgar had survived, deep on his cell system, with many of his slaves who were still deep down there. This was more than a setback, it meant that taking more prisoners from the kindgom would be dangerous, it meant that Jurgar wouldn't be able to keep feeding his fantasy with the blood of the human lands. It meant that king Mogarin would have more time to do it first. </p>
<p></p>
<p>  The werewolves would never stand a chance of reaching the moon.</p>
